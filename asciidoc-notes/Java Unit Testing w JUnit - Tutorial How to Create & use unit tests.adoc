= Java Unit Testing Notes

unit test:: a type of test done on software that isolates code down to single units & test the individual functionality of those individual units
    isolates one single unit 

* in java generally that single unit or peice of code is going to be a class, or even a method inside of that class
* Junit

== Junit

- to use junit all we have to do is add it as a dependency to in whatever dependency management tool you are using 

.simple calclator java
[source,java]
----
public class SimpleCalculator {

    public int add (int numberA, int numberB){
        return numberA + numberB;
    }
}
----

.simple calculator test
[source,java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Ignore;
import org.junit.Test;

class SimpleCalculatorTest {

    /* this is called a test annotation
    * in JUnit a unit test is just a method w thee @Test annotation above the declaration of the function.
    */  
    @Test
    void twoPlusTwoShouldEqualFour(){
        var calculator = new SimpleCalculator();
        assertEquals(expected:4, calculator.add(numberA:1, NumberB:2));
    }
}

=== how to we go about creating tests 

. create a test file in the src/test/java dir in your project
.
